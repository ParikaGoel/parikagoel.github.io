## Asynchronous Function Calls (std::async)

std::async is a way to achieve thread communication. It takes a callable object as an argument. This callable object serves as the promise and std::async returns a future. The returned future can be used to retrieve the result at a later point in time.

std::async can take any callable object as argument. Below code snipped shows usage with a function, function object and a lambda.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <string>

std::string callableFunc(const std::string& str)
{
    return str + " returned from function.\n";
}

struct CallableFuncObj{
    std::string operator()(const std::string& str) const
    {
        return str + " returned from function struct.\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    std::string hw = "Hello World ";
    CallableFuncObj funcObj;
    auto funcFut = std::async(callableFunc, hw);
    auto funcStrFut = std::async(funcObj, hw);
    auto lambdaFut = std::async([](const std::string& str){ return str + " returned from lambda.\n";}, hw);

    std::cout << funcFut.get();
    std::cout << funcStrFut.get();
    std::cout << lambdaFut.get();

    return 0;
}

```

### Lazy Execution

When the call to async is made, the callable object gets executed and the result is stored in the corresponding future. This result can be retrieved from the future object at any point in future. 

The execution of callable object can also be deferred to a later point in time by passing an extra argument to the async call.

std::launch::async - It tells the compiler to launch a separate thread to execute the callable object and execute it immediately.

std::launch::deferred - It tells the compiler to perform the execution of callable object in the same thread and delay it to the point when the result is asked for.

Syntax for both is as below:

```
// Eager and Lazy Evaluation
    auto eagerFut = std::async(std::launch::async, callableFunc, hw);
    auto lazyFut = std::async(std::launch::deferred, callableFunc, hw);
```

## My Attempt at Understanding GITA !!!

I sat down to write again after a long time. I have been reading a lot of content recently. Well I have been reading all my life. I find solace in reading. It serves as an escape from real life for me. At the same time, it is my medium to know more about the world. Maybe not the best way, but it has always worked for me. I have made an attempt to read Gita many times by now. But I never quite understood the significance of its teachings. I thought this time, I will put my understanding into writing. Maybe that will help me understand the teachings, Maharishi Vyasa Ji has tried to impart to the world.

To be honest, I still find it hard to believe and understand the concepts explained in this scripture but I will nevertheless put it down here. This is no way covers the entire extent of Gita. I am not capable enough to understand all of it. I have just put down whatever minimal I could understand, atleast I think I could.

- There is a universal consciousness which is the life force behind all living beings. This is one universal consciousness. And if this true, then all living beings on this planet are connected to each other. 
- There is an order behind the functioning of the universe as can be seen in the way day and night happens, sun rises in the east and sets in the west, basically all that rotation and revolution stuff of the celestial objects. And all this is happening in the universe just by itself. This is another way universal consciousness manifests itself. It knows how to run this world.
- It has been mentioned multiple times that we should just perform our actions and not attach ourselves to the fruits of our actions. This is called 'karma yoga'. We should establish an unwavering devotion to a higher altar and we should perform all our actions in a selfless dedicated devotion to that altar. This is also called performing our actions in yajna spirit. As per my limited understanding, this is the first step. First step towards what. I dont know. It has been given different terms - self realisation, self awareness, higher consciousness.To my limited mind, it feels like one way to get rid of anxieties and worries.
- Then there is 'yoga of practice' or 'yoga of meditation'. This is explained as the second step to achieving higher consciousness. Humans are basically encouraged to meditate. This should come only after we are actively practicing karma yoga in our life. We are encouraged to sit in silent solitude, remain motionless for a length of time and during that time, concentrate on our ideal with a laser focus. Whenever our mind wanders to other topics, which it would, we should consciously bring it back to our ideal.
